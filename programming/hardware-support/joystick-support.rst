Joystick Support
================

As of version 1.10, Panda3D gained built-in support for various input devices
including but not limited to joysticks, gamepads and steering wheels.
We recommend upgrading to 1.10 if you need this support.

For earlier versions of Panda, you can use PyGame or pyglet to get gamepad
support. There are various resources found in the forum that address this topic.
