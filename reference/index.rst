API Reference
=============

.. only:: python

   The Panda3D Python API consists of two packages: the :py:mod:`panda3d` core
   library, which is written in C++, and the :py:mod:`direct` library, which
   is written in Python.

   The API reference is not available for Panda3D 1.9.  Use the version
   selector to switch to the reference for Panda3D 1.10.

.. only:: cpp

   The C++ part of the API reference is still under construction.  In the
   meantime, please refer to the older Doxygen reference:
